# Project 3 - Gadddit

https://gadddit.herokuapp.com/

### An integrated platform for all your event needs!

Your event participants might find large / small crowds intimidating to ask questions.

Our platform is not only catered for such group of people, it may also help increasing engagement between organizer and participants, even after the event ends!

#### Engage and captivate your participants even more with our platform now!

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

When we attend a conference/ meeting / townhall, we might have questions that we would like to ask during the presentation without interrupting the presentation itself. Some of us may wish to ask those questions anonymously as well. As the presenter, we would also like to address these questions in further detail but are limited to the time allocated.

## PROBLEM SOLUTION

This app aims to allow participants to post any questions they have and the organisers can address those questions at their convenient. It also allows the organizer to follow up with the questions which were not addressed during the session. The app will help to keep track of all the Q&A for each events organized!
